# GraphQL+Express Server
this is the first step to setting up a fully provisioned backend
we will use JSON server as our temporary store of data feeding our app
- JSON server mocks a RESTful API to which our G+E server can send HTTP requests 

## Next Steps
- Replace our JSON server and make true connections to API and database resources
- Setup Apollo Client on the front end to send HTTP requests from the client to this server



## Setup Dependencies & File Structure
We are assuming a concurrent Front End heirarchy and will set up a separate server structure with package JSON. This modularization enhances code readability, maintainability and separaton of concerns
